# 🧭 What Data We Collect and Why

When you participate in a **PlanEasy** activity, you contribute to scientific research on cycling, urban mobility, and public space.  
Your contribution is voluntary and anonymous.  
We only collect the data that are essential for research and system operation — never for commercial use.

## 🚲 1. Questionnaire Responses

When you fill out a questionnaire, we collect the answers you provide about:

- **Your profile**: age group, gender, education, employment, household context.  
- **Your mobility habits**: how often you walk, cycle, or use public transport.  
- **Your perceptions**: how safe, comfortable, or convenient you find different routes or modes.  
- **Your experiences**: past incidents, attitudes, or motivations related to mobility.

These answers help researchers understand patterns and perceptions that influence everyday travel behaviour.

> 🧩 None of these fields identify you personally.  
> You can skip any question you prefer not to answer.

## 📍 2. Spatial and Mobility Data (if you use the app)

If you use an app connected to PlanEasy (for example, *theBIKEnet mobile app*), you may also share:

- **GPS traces of your trips** (location, time, duration)  
- **Trip purpose** (e.g., commute, leisure)  
- **Environmental notes or reports** (e.g., obstacles, unsafe crossings)  

These data are crucial for mapping cycling demand, evaluating safety conditions, and improving infrastructure.

> 📌 GPS points are automatically **filtered and anonymized** to remove areas near home or work before analysis.

## 🧠 3. Technical Metadata

To keep the system running smoothly, we collect limited technical data such as:

- The type of device or browser used  
- Timestamps when surveys are submitted  
- Anonymous session identifiers (for saving progress or detecting duplicates)

These are not linked to any personal information and are used only for research quality control and system maintenance.

## 🔒 How We Protect Your Data

| Principle | What it means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Pseudonymization** | Every participant is identified only by a random internal code (or a hashed email, if provided voluntarily). |
| **Data separation** | Personal contact data (when needed) are stored separately from survey and GPS data. |
| **Encryption** | All data transfers use HTTPS; databases are encrypted at rest. |
| **Limited access** | Only authorized research team members can view pseudonymized datasets. |
| **Transparency** | All documentation is public through the [planeasy-webgis repository](https://github.com/michetta91/planeasy-webgis). |

## 🧾 Legal and Ethical Context

Data are collected under the **GDPR Article 89** framework for *scientific research purposes*.  
Participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time by requesting deletion of your records.
