# 🛡️ Privacy Easy  
### How PlanEasy Protects Your Data

**PlanEasy** is a public research framework developed by [WEMO Lab](https://wemolab.eu) to support scientific studies and participatory mapping projects such as *theBIKEnet*.  
We care deeply about your privacy.  
This page explains, in simple terms, how your data are collected, used, and protected when you take part in PlanEasy activities.

## 🧩 1. What is PlanEasy?

PlanEasy is a web platform and toolkit that lets researchers, practitioners, and decision makers create digital questionnaires and interactive maps for collecting information on mobility, environment, and public space.  
When you participate, you help improve our understanding of cities — safely and anonymously.

## 🧭 2. What data do we collect?

We collect only what is strictly necessary for research purposes:
- **Survey answers**: your opinions, experiences, and habits about mobility or other study topics.  
- **GPS traces or map reports** *(only if you use a related app)*: to study how and where people move.  
- **Technical data**: such as timestamps and device type, to ensure smooth operation.  
- **Optional email**: to create an anonymous participation code if you choose to provide one.

> Your responses are anonymous.  
> We never ask for names, addresses, or other identifiers.

## 💡 3. Why do we collect data?

Because real-world evidence helps design better, safer, and more sustainable urban environments.  
The data collected through PlanEasy are used to **connect everyday experience with urban decision-making**.

Researchers, practitioners, and local decision-makers use these data to:

- study patterns and perceptions of mobility and public space,  
- evaluate infrastructure, accessibility, and safety,  
- compute indicators (KPIs) for planning and policy,  
- support participatory design processes and public dialogue,  
- and share anonymized results for educational, civic, and scientific purposes.

All analyses are performed on **aggregated and pseudonymized datasets**, ensuring that no individual person can ever be identified.  

> 🧭 In PlanEasy, citizens act as the eyes of the city — their observations and experiences help professionals and institutions understand what works and what needs to change.

No data are ever used for marketing, profiling, or commercial purposes.
